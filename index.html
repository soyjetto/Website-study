      DOOM Eternal: The Mastery of Flow
      <br>
        I intend to talk about the game DOOM Eternal.
      </br><br>
        I want to cover the the masterful way the game forces the player to play the game a certain way. It forces a kind of flow-state, and pushes you not only to learn it but pro-actively apply it and all the tools within in a 
        relatively small time scale. By making the mechanics intuitive and obvious, it can trust that the player will understand them and learn to apply them more and more effitiently as the game moves on, and by 
        increasing difficulty it can push the player to great lengths.
      </br><br> </br><br>
        I am also interested in discussion how this type of gameplay is reinforced by the raw, absurdly over the top personality and atmosphere that the game sports.
